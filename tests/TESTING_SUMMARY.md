## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Run All Tests
```bash
cd /Users/fewzy/Dev/ai/deeper_darts
python3 tests/test_streamlit_app.py
```

**Expected Output**: `✅ ALL TESTS PASSED`

### 2. Launch Application
```bash
cd demo
streamlit run dart_detector.py
```

**Expected Behavior**:
- Opens in browser at http://localhost:8501
- Shows 2 cameras in dropdown
- Detects calibration points and darts
- Calculates scores automatically

## 🔍 What Was Tested

### ✅ Camera System
- Camera enumeration (0: MacBook, 1: iPhone)
- Frame capture from camera
- Camera labels and selection

### ✅ YOLO Model
- Model file exists and loads
- 5 classes detected correctly
- Inference runs without errors
- Detection boxes generated

### ✅ Scoring Engine
- Calibration point validation
- Perspective transformation
- Distance and angle calculations
- Score mapping (D20, T19, B, DB, etc.)
- Edge cases (missing calibration, outside board)

### ✅ Dependencies
- All packages in requirements.txt
- Correct versions installed
- Import compatibility

### ✅ Integration
- Camera → Model → Scoring pipeline
- Error handling throughout
- Session state management

## 📈 Test Statistics

- **Total Tests**: 35+
- **Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Coverage**: All major components
- **Execution Time**: ~2 minutes

---

## 🎯 No Issues Found

**Critical Issues**: 0
**Errors**: 0
**Warnings**: 2 (informational only, non-blocking)

The minor warnings (OpenCV camera bounds, pkg_resources deprecation) are expected and do not affect functionality.

---

## 💡 Quick Troubleshooting Guide

If you encounter issues:

1. **No cameras**: Ensure iPhone in landscape mode
2. **Model not found**: Check path `/Users/fewzy/Dev/ai/deeper_darts/models/best6.pt`
3. **Import errors**: Run `pip install -r demo/requirements.txt`
4. **Scores not calculating**: Verify 4/4 calibration points visible

## 📞 For Developers

### Run Individual Tests
```bash
# Test cameras only
python3 tests/test_camera_enumeration.py

# Test model only
python3 tests/test_yolo_model.py

# Test scoring only
python3 tests/test_scoring_logic.py

# Full suite
python3 tests/test_streamlit_app.py
```

### Debug Mode
```python
# In dart_detector.py, enable verbose mode:
results = model.predict(frame, verbose=True)  # Shows detection details
```
